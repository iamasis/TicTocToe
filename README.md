# TicTocToe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking spaces with "X" or "O" symbols. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins. It's a simple yet engaging game that's often used for teaching basic programming concepts and game theory.
